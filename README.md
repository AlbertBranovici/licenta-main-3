This is my bachelors project for my final year. The app is written in python and it's a password manager. The app features a GUI made using pyqt5 and offers options such as password generator, a backend server and a browser extension for viewing the saved data.

This is what the GUI looks like. In this picture you can see the add entry window and the password generator. The generator uses random.choices() function to generate a random password from a string made with the selected character sets.
